    This is an alternative to the `content` property. It allows to specify variants of the same content, one per language.
    
    Usage:
    - If your assistants are multilingual, you can provide content for each language.
    - If you don't provide content for a language, the first item in the array will be automatically translated to the active language at that moment.
    
    This will override the `content` property.
